# Dynamically Populate Your Navbar Using Sections and Liquid
As a Shopify developer focused on creating optimized store themes, responsive and intuitive navigation is essential. Whether on desktop, mobile or tablet, an effective navbar shapes the user experience from the first interaction. So it automatically becomes a top priority for us at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/). However, as products and pages evolve over time, static menus cannot adapt.

This challenge is what drove me to explore the power of Liquid templating. By dynamically querying content sections, I can build components like navigation that automatically update alongside changes. Editors simply modify content in one place, confident each update consistently propagates.

When building for Shopify's dynamic environment, static designs have weaknesses. As selections and collections shift daily, rigid layouts lose their value. But with Liquid's logic, we access robust tools to tie interfaces directly into living content. Gone are endless duplications across hundreds of theme files.

One prime candidate for this approach is site-wide navigation. Of all core elements, none make or break the experience like intuitive browsing pathways. Rather than rigid limiting text, envision flexible structures adapting perpetually.

By tapping Liquid's conditional and iterative strength, we'll generate fully responsive, dynamically updating menus. Readers will learn skills to future-proof any interface against constant content fluctuations. So let's jump straight to illuminated these techniques and optimize navigation for endless evolving stories.



## Laying the Foundations

Our first job is constructing the basic framework that will hold the dynamic navigation menu. Start by making a new Liquid template called `navbar.liquid`.

Within this file, we'll need some core HTML elements to serve as our "foundation":

```liquid
<nav id="navbar">
  <ul>
  </ul>
</nav> 
```

This creates an outer `<nav>` container with an `id` attribute for styling later. Nested is an empty unordered list `<ul>` - the spot where our generated links will go. 

For accessibility, links always belong inside a semantic list element rather than loose fragments. This `<ul>` acts as a placeholder until we populate it.

But what data will we populate it with? Our navigation categories likely exist as global Shopify sections like "Products" or "Blog". Rather than hardcode these, we can tap directly into the native section objects.

Below the list, drop in this Liquid code to hook into that content source:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include 'sections' %} 
{% endraw %}
```

This pulls the necessary section definitions into our template. In the next step, we'll cycle through these and dynamically inject them as clickable menu anchors. 

But first we've established the basic scaffold - the foundation on which the dynamic menu experience will be built.


## Bringing the Navigation to Life

Now that our basic framework is in place, it's time to imbue it with living, dynamic content. We'll tap into the sections data to populate each menu item automatically.

Within the `navbar.liquid` template, add this code below the placeholder unordered list:

```liquid
{% for section in sections %}

  <li>
    <a href="{{ section.url }}"> 
      {{ section.title }}
    </a>
  </li>

{% endfor %}  
```

This `for` loop iterates through the collection of global section objects retrieved earlier. On each pass, it injects a new list item (`<li>`) containing an anchor link.

The anchor's `href` draws its destination from the section's unique URL path. Meanwhile, its visible text displays the familiar title such as "Home" or "About Us". 

By iteration's end, we've constructed a complete menu synced dynamically to the sections in the admin backend. Changes below like adding, removing or reordering pages will propagate above instantly. 

We've molded a truly adaptive component that self-synchronizes with fluctuations over time. Let's preview how vibrantly it comes to life within the site navigation.







## Fabricating Dynamic Links 

It's now time to construct the individual navigation items linked to our section data. Within the loop, include:

```liquid
<li>
  <a href="{{ section.url }}">
    {{ section.title }}
  </a>
</li>
```

On each cycle, this assembles a list member housing an anchor tag. The `section.url` is drawn straight from the backend to populate its address.

The display `section.title` is emitted to label each link clearly.

And for sound HTML:

```liquid
  </a>
</li>
```

The end result? A fully-formed navigation where additions or changes below brew fluid reactions above. 

Any further sections integrated into the admin will immediately blend into the menu seamlessly.

Let's observe how artfully this liquid recipe brings the backend ingredients together in a preview. The dynamic links now flow and interact on every update!

The fabrication is complete - refresh to see the fluid results firsthand.





## Activate Navigation with Conditionals

We can use liquid logic to selectively accentuate the matching navigation item.

Wrap the anchor link code in an `if` statement to target the right section:

```liquid
{% if section.id == page.section.id %}
```

This checks if the looped section ID equals the ID of the active section stored in `page`.

Add a class to spotlight the activated selection: 

```liquid
<li>
  <a href="{{ section.url }}" class="active-link">
   {{ section.title }}
  </a>
</li> 
```

Close the conditional block:

```liquid
{% endif %}
```

Now only the nav item tied to the current page will ignite with the “active-link” designation on each request.

On page loads, the associated path illuminates to guide shoppers intuitively. Refresh to see the conditional torch pass fluidly between links!

Our navigation awakens dynamically through conditional activation.




## Ensuring Proper Nesting for Accessible Navigation

For our dynamically generated navigation to display correctly and be accessible to all users, it is important that we close all open tags properly. 

After iterating through each navigation item, we need to close the containing unordered list:

```liquid
</ul>
```

We also should close each list item element at the end of its loop:

```liquid
  </li>  
```

Then, when rendering the full navigation markup, the nested lists will be valid HTML:

```liquid
<nav>
  <ul>
    {% for section in sections %}

      <li>

      </li>

    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</nav>
```

By closing all parent and child elements intentionally, we structure the semantics as nested unordered lists rather than leaving stray open tags. 

This ensures the navigation will render as intended across all devices and browsers. It also improves accessibility for assistive technologies like screen readers.

Let's validate our work by previewing the accessible navigation - the list items should now be properly nested and closed for all users.


## Rendering the Navigation Consistently Across Templates

For a coherent user experience, we need the navigation to display uniformly on every page. To achieve this, we'll incorporate it into the site's core template structure.

### Injecting the Semantic Navbar Markup 

We can output the navigation code by including this Liquid tag in our layout template header:

```liquid
{{ 'navbar' | liquid }}
```

Placing it here will render the nested `<ul>` and `<li>` elements that comprise the navbar snippet.

### Validating the Semantic Integration

By refreshing a page now, we can confirm that our semantic markup is properly propagated throughout the template hierarchy. 

The navbar should integrate smoothly as intended, guiding users routinely between pages. Screen readers will interpret the navigation identically on all interfaces as well.

With the navigation structurally defined once in the layout, its semantics remain consistent for all users. Template logic and HTML semantics thus unite to provide a uniformly accessible experience across our entire digital presence.

This approach eliminates redundant menu maintenance while providing an optimized user experience. However, there are many opportunities to expand on this functionality as needs arise.
